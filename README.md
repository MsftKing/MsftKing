- Hello, I'm @MsftKing or Ryan, whichever you prefer.
-I've spent the last few months mulling over what I want to do in life and I took it upon myself to learn to trades to determine if something feels right and in doing so,
I have discoverd that I really enjoy coding and want to get into the tech industry.
- What have I been working on? Well, that is not so easy to explain but I can try. Hal and I have decided that we are going to build our first game using Unreal Engine which is a
  learning curve in itself seeing that I have never coded anything a day in my life. But I guess that is where this all begins... (11/2023)
