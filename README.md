<br> Hello I'm Ryan. I'm currently working as a Manager during the day and focusing on growing my skills as a game developer and software engineer during the evening. As myself and fellow Co-Founder of Liminality Gaming continue to grow our skills and knowledge we are working towards releasing a few games in 2024. We are working on creating a fantasy open-world RPG, which will not be published until late 2025/2026 and a platform game to be published in 2024 on Mac/PC/iOS/Android. 
<br></br>
I'm interested in various topics. <br> </br>
  <li>AI fundamentals and the utilization in accessibility</li>
  <li>Game Development Animation</li>
  <li>Game Development using C# and C++</li>
